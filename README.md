Clojure solutions to Advent of Code, http://adventofcode.com/

A couple of points

* Solutions may not be the most efficient/elegant/concise, as I'm still learning the language.
* Rather than reading in the test inputs from text files, I'm using Emacs keyboard macros to transform them into code so I can cut out the less interesting parsing step - see resources/input.clj. 

## Usage

To see the solutions for each problem using the inputs provided:

    $ lein run

The problems usually provide test cases which can be run with

    $ lein test
