Python solutions to [Advent of Code 2023](http://adventofcode.com/2023).

## Running

The puzzle solutions were written using Python 3.11 and uses the
standard library except:

* Day 24 needs [Z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3)

You will need to provide input data and (if known) solutions to each
puzzle, as this differs for each user. Create files named `input`,
`solution.a` and `solution.b` in the `data/full/NN` directory where
`NN` is the day number. See `data/full/00` for an example.

After this is done, simply run `./aoc.py` from this directory to
execute all puzzles. You can optionally provide a number as a command
line argument to just run one day.

## Tests

Ensure you have pytest installed on your path and then run `pytest`.
This uses the sample data provided in the puzzle text, which has been
placed in `data/sample/`.
