Python solutions to [Advent of Code 2023](http://adventofcode.com/2023).

## Running

The puzzle solutions were written using Python 3.11 and the standard library.

You will need to provide input data and (if known) solutions to each
puzzle, as this differs for each user. Create files named `input`,
`solution.a` and `solution.b` in the `data/full/NN` directory where
`NN` is the day number. See `data/full/00` for an example.

After this is done, simply run `./aoc.py` from this directory to
execute all puzzles. You can optionally provide a number as a command
line argument to just run one day.

## Tests

Ensure you have pytest installed on your path and then run `pytest`. A
couple of long running tests (for brute force solutions) are skipped
by default.
